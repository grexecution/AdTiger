# Vercel Deployment Setup

## Required Environment Variables

You MUST set these environment variables in Vercel for the app to work properly:

### 1. AUTH_SECRET (CRITICAL!)
Generate a secure random string for NextAuth session encryption:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
Set this value as `AUTH_SECRET` in Vercel environment variables.

### 2. NEXTAUTH_URL
Set to your Vercel deployment URL:
- Production: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- Preview: Can use the same or leave empty for auto-detection

### 3. Database
Set your PostgreSQL connection string:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database?schema=public"
```

### 4. Optional Services
- `BULLMQ_REDIS_URL` - If you want to use queue features (not required for basic functionality)
- `META_APP_ID`, `META_APP_SECRET` - For Meta Ads integration
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI features

## Setting Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your project in Vercel Dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add each variable with the appropriate value
4. Make sure to select the correct environments (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Redeploy after adding variables

## Common Issues

### "Auto logged in" or "Can't log out"
This happens when `AUTH_SECRET` is not set. The auth system creates invalid sessions without it.

### "Cannot access login page"
The middleware redirects authenticated users away from auth pages. If you have an invalid session due to missing `AUTH_SECRET`, you'll be stuck in a redirect loop.

### Fix Steps:
1. Set `AUTH_SECRET` in Vercel
2. Clear your browser cookies for the domain
3. Redeploy the application
4. Try accessing the site again

## Testing Authentication

After setting up environment variables:

1. Visit `/auth/login`
2. Use demo credentials:
   - admin@demo.com / admin123
   - pro@demo.com / demo123
   - free@demo.com / demo123
3. Verify logout works properly
